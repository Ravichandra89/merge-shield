# üìñ Description

**Merge-Shield** adds intelligent pre-submission checks to improve software quality.  
It automates code analysis, enforces standards, and ensures every PR meets quality gates before merging.

### üîπ Key Capabilities

- Automated code analysis & style validation
- Configurable, extensible rules engine
- Pre-submission workflows for commits & PRs
- Pluggable integrations (linters, security, formatters)
- Boosts developer productivity by catching issues early

## üîπ Architecture Overview

The architecture of Merge-Shield mirrors the clean, modular, and extensible structure evident in Presubmit.ai‚Äôs implementation. Here's the breakdown:

### 1. Core Engine

- The heart of the system that orchestrates pre-submission validation workflows.
- Listens to incoming pull requests or commits, and triggers associated analysis processes.

### 2. Rules & Validation Modules

- Contains individual rule modules for static checks like linting, bug detection, security analysis, or summarization.
- Each rule runs independently and returns structured feedback, enabling granular checks.

### 3. Integration Layer

- A dynamic loader that instantiates rule processors and integrations‚Äîsuch as different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini), linters, or scanners.
- Keeps the core engine agnostic to specific implementations.

### 4. Event & Observer System

- Follows the **Observer Pattern** to notify subscribers (e.g., CI/CD pipeline, GitHub Actions, Slack bot) whenever a rule passes or fails.
- Provides real-time feedback to developers during the submission process.

### 5. Summarization Module & Feedback

- Aggregates results from rule modules.
- Generates comprehensive summaries, annotated comments, and suggested fixes directly within PRs.

### 6. Extensibility

- Supports custom rules via configuration files.
- Allows third-party developers to add plugins without modifying the system‚Äôs internals.

## 7. CI/CD & Process Integration

- Seamlessly integrates with GitHub Actions, CI pipelines, or other VCS workflows.
- Commits must pass Merge-Shield validations before merging, similar to how Presubmit.ai gates pull requests .

This layered design ensures that Merge-Shield remains flexible, maintainable, and scalable‚Äîjust like Presubmit.ai. It empowers teams to plug in their own code validators, enable interpretable feedback, and evolve the system without breaking the core.

## üîπ Usage

### Step 1: Add LLM_API_KEY secret

    1. Go to your repository's Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions.
    2. Click "New Secrets"
    3. Add a new secret with:
        - Name: LLM_API_KEY
        - Value: Put your original API Key from one of these providers:
            - OpenAI API
            - Google AI Studio (Gemini)

### Step 2: Create GitHub WorkFlow

    Add this Github Action to your repository by creating .github/workflows/merge-shield.yml:
    ```bash
    name: Merge-Shield

    permissions:
        contents: read
        pull-requests: write
        issues: write

    on:
        pull_request_target:
        types: [opened, synchronize]
        pull_request_review_comment:
        types: [created]

    jobs:
        review:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps: 
                - name: Check required secrets
                  run: |
                    if [ -z "${{ secrets. LLM_API_KEY }}" ]; then
                      echo "Error: LLM_API_KEY secret is not configured"
                      exit 1
                    fi 
                - uses: Ravichandra89/merge-shield@main
                env:
                   GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
                   LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
                   LLM_MODEL: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
    ```
    The Action Requires: 
        - Github Token: Automatically Provided by GitHub Actions
        - LLM_API_KEY: Your API Key
        - LLM_MODEL: Define which LLM model to use. Make sure model is supported and matches the LLM_API_KEY.

## üîß Example Workflow

1. **Developer Workflow**:
   - Developer writes code and commits changes.
   - Husky pre-commit hook triggers linting and formatting via lint-staged and Prettier.
   - If linting or formatting fails, commit is aborted.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - On push to the repository, CI/CD pipeline is triggered.
   - Pipeline installs dependencies and runs tests using Vitest.
   - If tests pass, code is deployed; if tests fail, deployment is halted.

3. **merge-shield Checks**:
   - Before merging pull requests, merge-shield checks ensure code quality and test coverage.
   - Checks include linting, formatting, type checking, and test execution.
   - Only code that passes all checks is merged into the main branch.
